<i>By the way the reason I hesitate to market this, is because I originally intended this as a suicide letter back when I wrote the novel. It's however more obvious in the novella version: http://uploadedfairy.thecomicseries.com/audiodrama/ This was back when I deliberately poisoned myself, to punish myself for what I thought were symtpoms of autosanguephilia. This was back when I was part of The Satanic Temple. That doesn't mean it's a memoir, just that there is an element of Hemato-Tomato that is true.</i>

Hemato-Tomato is an apprentice executioner to her father, and is in love with her best friend Ehena-Maerie. However, she does not want to inherit the job of state-headswoman. Yet there is a darker secret that prevents her from living her life as a normal trans girl: her autosanguephilia. She wants to ran away to the midwest, but Ehena-Maerie leaves her behind. When she returns, Ehena is to be executed by Hemato herself. Torn betweem her sexual desires for Ehena's neck, and her desires to not see only true justice prevail, she must choose: Ehena's blood or Ehena's love.

Nadine Melville, a trans woman with a similar secret addiction to blood, lives as a normal person. But when she finds a mysterious computer game that allows her to live out her fantasies, she initially decides to give into her impulses. However when the choice is between getting permanent brain damage with Hemato taunting her every move, and saving Millie who she gradually comes to live, she must choose between death or rescuing a princess she hates that reminds her of beautiful women she despises, being jelouse of their beutiy, to return home to the real world.

Set after the Franco-Japanese wars, Ros wierudos Egunos mark the pavement of a new era in blood.
