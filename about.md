# About Uploaded Fairy
Uploaded Fairy is a Post Apocalyptic webcomic about the aftermath of the invasions by the French and Japanese in a future crumbled United  States, and the eventual civil war between French and Japanese  controlled American factions. It also ventures into the Cyberpunk world, where a young hacker finds a mysterious game that takes her to a  fantasy world called Voreth's Promise.

This syndication reads right to left.

It is also partially in Hafestran Conlang. There are two versions:

Uploaded Fairy Era: https://hafestrahandbook.glitch.me/
O Raphael Era: https://personaljournal.ca/hafestra-conlang/

Uploaded Fairy era is early Hafestra, which was closer to French. O Raphael era ( modern Hafestra ) is still a romance language, but closer to Japanese do to the Japanese loan words. But it is not 100% mutually intelligible.
